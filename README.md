## Setup and Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lildibbb/Physiotherapy-Treatment-Booking-System.git
cd Physiotherapy-Treatment-Booking-System
```

### 2. Set up environment variables

Create the .env file based on the provided .env.example:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then, update the .env file with your specific environment variables, such as your database credentials and API keys.

### Generate VAPID Keys

Before using push notifications in the PWA, you need to generate VAPID keys. Run the following command to generate the keys:

```bash
cd backend
bun run keys
```

This script will generate the VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY and VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY. After running the script, add these keys to your .env file:

```bash
VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=your_generated_public_key
VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY=your_generated_private_key
VITE_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=your_generated_public_key
```

Replace your_generated_public_key and your_generated_private_key with the actual keys generated by the script.

### Get Stripe API Key

Sign up for a Stripe account and retrieve your Stripe API Key. Add the key to the .env file:

Log in to your Stripe Dashboard.
Navigate to Developers > API Keys.
Copy the Publishable Key and Secret Key and add them to your .env file under the relevant sections.

### 3. Install dependencies

Use Bun to install all necessary dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

### 4. Database Setup (Backend)

Navigate to the backend directory and run the following commands to set up the database:

```bash
cd backend
bun generate  # Generates necessary models and files
bun migrate   # Applies database migrations
```

### 5. Running the Project

Once everything is set up, you can run the project with this command in root directory:

```bash

bun dev
```

This will start both the frontend and backend services, allowing you to interact with the system locally.

2. **Stripe Payment Gateway**: Instructions for setting up Stripe API keys and integrating it into the system.
3. **API Key**: You now need to fetch your Stripe API keys and add them to the `.env` file to ensure payments are processed securely.
